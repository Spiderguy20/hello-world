A short description

This is a really short description of the project.  Some descriptions are long but not this one.  No sir.  This one is short. Not long but short.  Really short.  In fact this may be the shortest project description ever.  Of course there's no way to know that for sure.  I mean, you'd have to check every project ever made.  That's a daunting task.  So we'll just assumne that this is the shortest description ever and move.  Nice and short and to the point.  No rambling at all.  Very concise.  Now let's move.  Here we go.
This is the end of the short description.
